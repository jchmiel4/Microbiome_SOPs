# Burton lab process for extracting DNA for microbiome sequencing
###### Kait Al, PhD. 2023


## Overview

This a modified protocol for the Qiagen DNeasy 96 PowerSoil Pro Kit with notes specific for Burton Lab's equipment.

Sample loading will be sample-type-specific.



Important notes before starting: 
* Use a fresh lab coat every time
* Wear gloves
* Sterilize the BSC with UV and RNAseZap
* Spray out the centrifuge and rotor with RNAseZap
* Turn on the dry heat bath to ~85 C (in reality this will be 60 C)
* If Solution CD3 has precipitated, heat at 60°C until the precipitate dissolves
* Heat solution C6 to 60°C before final elution
* Perform all centrifugation steps at room temperature (15-25 C)
* Use the electronic multichannel pipettor (Unit 1) and DNA extraction-specific Gilson pipettes stored in the extraction room

## Procedure

1. Centrifuge a PowerBead Pro Plate briefly to ensure that the beads have settled at the bottom. (1 minute at max speed, 3700 RPM or 2250 x g in eppendorf centrifuge)

2. Remove and discard the square well mat from the PowerBead Pro Plate. Add up to 0.25 g of soil sample or up to 0.1 g of stool sample in each well. 
	Note: Avoid cross contamination between sample wells.
	1. Stool samples: use a filter pipette tip to scoop up approximately 0.2 g sample and scrape it off the tip into the base of the well.
	2. Stool on toilet paper: use 10% bleach and RNAseZap sterilized forceps and scissors to dissect off a single-ply piece of visibly soiled TP approximately 1 cm x 1cm.
